# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Hey Everyone! I just got a Raspberry Pi, and my first thought was to use it to show people how to boost their home business by creating a Jekyll blog. I've been wanting to start a blog on reviewing white papers and implementing small open source projects for a while. Using the raspberry Pi as a lens to focus this idea seems like as good a starting place as any. For those interested in getting involved, here is the git repo:
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
